Renamed: 
- RLAPI void CloseWindow(void) to RLAPI void TerminateWindow(void)  in "raylib/src/raylib.h"
- void CloseWindow(void) to void TerminateWindow(void) in "raylib/src/rcore.c"

Reason being that there's a native windows function called CloseWindow() thus the x64 linker can't properly link against this raylib function
